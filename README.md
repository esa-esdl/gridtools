# gridtools - Python tools for geo-spatial grids

## Modules

### Module ``gridtools.resampling``

While there exists a number of Python functions that can be used to upsample geo-spatial 
images and grids to a higher spatial resolution, there is a generally a lack in methods 
that perform grid cell aggregation for downsampling grids to a coarser spatial resolution. 
Most of the existing aggregation methods assume an integer factor between a source and its 
target grid so that contributions of partly overlapping grid cell areas don't exist.

The ``gridtools.resampling`` module provides the high-performance
regridding functions ``resample_2d()``, ``upsample_2d()``, and ``downsample_2d()``. 

Downsampling can take into account partial contributions of source grid cells for a given target grid cell; 
it performs a weighted aggregation of grid cell contributions. 

* Method ``DS_FIRST``: Take first valid source grid cell, ignore contribution areas.
* Method ``DS_LAST``: Take last valid source grid cell, ignore contribution areas.
* Method ``DS_MEAN``: Compute average of all valid source grid cells, with weights given by contribution area.  
* Method ``DS_MODE``: Compute most frequently seen valid source grid cell, 
  with frequency given by contribution area. Note that this method can use an additional keyword argument
  *mode_rank* which can be used to generate the "n-th Mode". See ``downsample_2d()``.
* Method ``DS_VAR``: Compute the biased weighted estimator of variance
  (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_square_weighted_deviation), with weights given by contribution area.
* Method ``DS_STD``: Compute the corresponding standard deviation to the biased weighted estimator
  of variance which is basically the square root of the result of method ``DS_VAR``.

The methods ``DS_MEAN``, ``DS_VAR`` ``DS_STD`` are most useful for downsampling grids whose cell values represent 
continuous values, e.g. temperatures, radiation.

The methods ``DS_FIRST``, ``DS_LAST`` ``DS_MODE`` are most useful for downsampling grids whose cell 
values represent classes, e.g. surface types, flags.

Currently, only two upsampling methods are provided:

* Method ``US_NEAREST``: Take nearest source grid cell, even if it is invalid.
* Method ``US_LINEAR``: Bi-linear interpolation between the 4 nearest source grid cells.


### Module ``gridtools.gapfilling``

The module provides functions that allow filling grid cells whose values are not *finite* by means of the
``numpy.isfinite()`` function. Two gap-filling methods are available:

* Function ``fillgaps_lowpass_2d()``: Fills cell values by averaging values of direct neighbours using a given kernel.
   This is repeated for the whole grid until all gaps are filled.
   * Pros: Simple and obviously working well for mostly isolated, single cell gaps.
   * Cons: Naive. Relatively slow, if gaps form larger connected areas. In this case gap border patterns propagate
     into gap area centers at multiples of 45 degree angles, producing strange visual artifacts, and usually an
     implausible distribution of filled values.
* Method ``fillgaps_multiscale_2d()``: Similar to ``fillgaps_lowpass_2d()`` but tries to get around its disadvantages:
     Cell values are filled in by averaging values of direct neighbours. Then the resulting grid is downsampled by a
     factor of two. If the downsampled grid still has gaps, the procedure is repeated recursively until the downsampled
     version contains no more gaps or it comprises only a single cell. Each gap-filled, downsampled grid serves as
     a source for gaps in the upsampled, 2x higher resolution grid until the original resolution is reached and all
     gaps are filled (or none).


## Limitations
 
* All resampling methods assume the target grids to be in the same coordinate space,
  hence only a grid scaling is applied where the geometric boundaries and coverage of source and target 
  remain the same.
* All methods are currently 2D only because our primary goal is to perform *spatial* resampling.
* Upsampling is currently limited to only two methods. Use existing alternatives instead such as 
  ``scipy.misc.imresize`` or similar.    

## Use of Numba

gridtools uses [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) to JIT-compile the resampling functions as it speeds up
computations by up to a several hundred times (!) compared to plain Python.

gridtools is tested with Numba in Miniconda or Anaconda environments.

To disable JIT compilation (e.g. for unit-level testing), set environment variable ``NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT``
to a non-zero value.

There is an issue in Numba that currently limits its use in certain
cases when grids are represented by numpy masked arrays, see https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/1834
